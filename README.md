## Freebox Java Helper
Freebox Java Helper is a java-based library that helps you interact with your Freebox Server through its public APIs.

These Public APIs are documented by Free SAS [here](https://dev.freebox.fr/sdk).

## Quick Start
Using the Freebox Server APIs requires the creation by the server of an application token. This token is automatically generated by the Freebox during the "authorize" process and you HAVE TO save this token locally to be able to use it later in the login call. This process can ONLY be achieved from within you local network.

````
// Get singleton instance
FreeBoxHelper helper = FreeBoxHelper.getInstance();

// Initialize helper with local-only ip address (mafreebox.freebox.fr) and HTTP port (80)
helper.init("mafreebox.freebox.fr", "80");

// Start authorize process
// You have to do this only once for your application provided it does not change its version/name
// Once this process is started, you will have less than a minute to grant access 
// to your application on the Freebox Server LCD panel (select "Oui" with the right arrow)
Future<String> result = helper.authorize();

// Important !!!
// Save this token so that you can later use it for any subsequent call
String appToken = result.get();
// Important !!!

// Now create a new session to be able to call the APIs
helper.login();

// As an example, let's get the call log
List<CallEntry> callLog = helper.getCallLog();
callLog.stream().forEach((c) -> System.out.println("Number: "+c.getNumber()+" on "+c.getDatetime()));

// Close session
helper.logout();
